Editing with Potlatch 2
=======================

**Introduction**
Potlatch 2 is the OpenStreetMap editor you get when you click on 
the 'Edit' tab of the osm website, it was rewritten from the original Potlatch, 
and it includes a What You See Is What You Get(WYSIWYG) rendering.

You can use it to add new roads, buildings, and other features to the map, as well as changing existing ones.
Online means that you do not have to download or install anything: you can make live edits,
as long as you have a good internet connection, and a web browser with flash player installed on your computer.

**How to run Potlatch**
-----------------------

1. Open your browser (Flash/Gnash/SWF-enabled), and go to OpenStreetMap.
2. Login .
3. Search, locate and zoom into the area you want to edit.
4. Click the "Edit" tab, or hover the mouse over the edit tab and select potlatch 2, then potlatch
   will be launched within the browser

Note: 
- Incase the browser is not flash enabled, potlatch 2 will not be launched, but there will be
  a link on the page from where you can download and install adobe flash player.
- When you click edit without logging into your OpenStreetMap account, you will
  be asked to login in order to edit the map.

### The Interface
When you open potlatch for the first time, there will be an interface (see image below)
with tools to help you edit the map, in most cases, a help window will be displayed with quick tips
and buttons/tabs which you can navigate to show how to use potlatch.

Click “Ok” when you are done with going through the tips, to start editing.

The potlatch editing interface is organized the same way as the osm main page, it has the left panel, menu bar,
the aerial/satellite view, the toolbox, zoom in/out buttons with the search icon, which all have different
functionalities;

- image controls for potlatch editing

1. **The Menu Bar**
It has controls like the save, undo and redo buttons (inactive until there are changes made to the map)
used to save, reverse and resume someone's edits.

When saving edits for the first time, a text box pops up, where you can write a description of your changes
which are recorded in a “change set”.

The background tab, has a drop down that enables selection of different layers and satellite providers
over which to edit in potlatch such as (Bing aerial imagery, mapBox Satellite OSM-mapnik, e.t.c).
The background is not editable.

The map style changes the visual appearance of the potlatch editing nodes and lines between wire-frame,
enhanced, OpenCycleMap and Potlatch, but the functionality remains the same and
you can customize styles to have a keyboard shortcut for each.

The gps data tab enables loading of GPS traces uploaded in a gpx file to the OpenStreetMap database by users 
to view gps data in an area, view their very own uploaded gps traces and clear the display of gps data.

The options tab provides you with other settings for potlatch, such as displaying and removing the tool box,
showing the mouse latitude/longitude as you map, and the contextual help bar at the bottom of the editing window.

2. **The Satellite / Aerial View (Bing Imagery)**
This shows features from the overhead pictures taken from a plane or satellite, zoom in one level at a time
(depending on your internet connection) for a clear view of features.In some areas the satellite imagery will
disappear beyond certain zoom levels.

Levels between 17 – 19 will be clear enough for the bing imagery to act as a background which shows 
visible features that can be edited directly if you know what they represent, such as buildings, land use, and roads.

Features traced with the bing imagery need to be tagged and named in order to be represented on the map. 
Areas that do not have the satellite imagery available will show a white blank background. The Bing maps imagery
is provided by Microsoft.

3. **Zoom (in/out) and Search icon**
Use these controls when you want to zoom in and out of an area that you would like to edit
(plus (+) for zooming in, and (-) for zooming out), depending on the speed of the Internet connection,
zoom one level at a time, then wait for the data in that area to load, before you start editing.

The search icon enables you to find a different place of interest, that can be edited without leaving the
potlatch editing interface, a dialogue where you can search for an area to edit is presented,
where you can type and receive results from which to select where to edit.

4. **Editing panel**
This panel has editing tools that can be used by simply dragging and dropping icons to their
corresponding features, the result is a node with a name/icon of what is represented.
The simple editing mode presents a user with graphical icons that show images that relate to different features.

The panel icons (images) show how the named features will be rendered in the osm standard mode (view),
they are grouped according to categorizes like: shopping, food and drink, amenity, transport, water, and so on.

5. **The Tool Box**
The tool box assists you to make accurate features by straightening, joining nodes, merging, deleting, and 
making nodes square, parallel, round and reversing the direction for different ways.

###Potlatch Editing Tips
Before you begin editing, the first rule is the use of proprietary data: data from
copyrighted maps or any other proprietary data is strictly prohibited!. Tracing, or any act of
reproduction of copyrighted work is not allowed!

**Points of interest**
Linear features such as streets, footpaths, railways, and building outlines may be referred to as ways.
You can edit points for shops, health centers, schools, and the like by simply double-clicking at the right location.
- Select to highlight the point.
- Drag the point around with the mouse
- Press Delete (or Backspace) to remove the point.
- Press Esc to revert all your changes.

*To insert a new node on a way*
- Click on the way to highlight it, then Shift-click at the desired place where to draw the new node.
*To insert a new single node*
- Double click at the desired place.
- To delete, click on the node to highlight it, and Press Delete or Backspace.

**Drawing a new way**
A way is a line that you draw on the map: it might be a road, a railway, a river, a fence, a boundary or a
power line. Each way is a series of joined 'points' (or nodes).
Draw the ways using your own knowledge of what features exist, using track logs of
journeys you have made with a GPS receiver; or by tracing from the satellite photo background. (Bing! Aerial Imagery).
*Steps*
- Click on the map to start a new way.
- Click at each successive point. If you make a mistake, press Delete (or Backspace).
- To finish, double-click, press Enter, Esc, or click the start point again to make a loop.
*If you make a mistake*
- Press Delete or Backspace (while drawing) to remove just the last point.
- Press Esc to cancel the whole way and to stop drawing.

**To extend a way**
- Click on the first or last point to highlight it. (or press shift + click).
  A small black dot may appear next to your cursor.
- Move the cursor in the direction you want to extend the way.
  A black line will extend from the last node to your cursor. Click to create a new node.
  Keep drawing points to continue extending the way.
- To finish, double-click on the last node or press Enter. If you are making a loop, click the start
  point again just once.
*To delete an entire way or segment of a way:*
- Click on the way to highlight it, and press Delete or Backspace.

**Undoing mistakes**
If you make a mistake while editing, you can change it before it is saved to the server, or cancel it
entirely with the Esc key, but if you have saved it and realize you've made a mistake, you can click the
undo tab on the menu bar, or press 'Z' or 'Ctl + Z', to undo the mistake.

**Realigning the Background Layer**
- With background images, sometimes you'll notice they are not aligned with the OSM data.
  If this is the case, hold down Space on your keyboard and drag the background image to its correct location.

**GPS data/My tracks**
- Selecting the GPS tab on the menu bar will display gps traces, and on the drop down arrow
  gps data will display thin blue lines representing all gps tracks in the area.
- Selecting My tracks will enable display of a dialogue with your own tracks that you loaded into OSM
  via the GPS traces; upload a trace function.
- Selecting clear will switch gps traces off in the editor, or go to Background -> Vector file... and unselect GPS.
